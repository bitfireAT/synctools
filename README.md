    repositories {
        // ... more repos
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

or if you are using `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        // ... more repos
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}

   implementation 'com.github.bitfireat:synctools:<commit-id>'
}
```
