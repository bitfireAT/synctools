/**
 * Represents a set of components (like VEVENT) stored in a calendar object resource as defined
 * in RFC 4791 section 4.1. It consists of
 *
 * - an (optional) main component,
 * - optional exceptions of this main component.
 *
 * Note: It's possible and valid that there's no main component, but only exceptions, for instance
 * when the user has been invited to a specific instance (= exception) of a recurring event, but
 * not to the event as a whole (→ main event is unknown / not present).
 *
 * @param main          main component (with or without UID, but without RECURRENCE-ID), may be `null` if only exceptions are present
 * @param exceptions    exceptions (each without RECURRENCE-ID); UID must be
 *   1. the same as the UID of [main],
 *   2. the same for all exceptions.
 * @param prodId        optional `PRODID` related to the components
 *
 * If no [main] is present, [exceptions] must not be empty.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException   when the constraints above are violated
