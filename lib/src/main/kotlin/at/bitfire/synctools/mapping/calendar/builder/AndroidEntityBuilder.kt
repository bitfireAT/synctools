     * Maps a specific part of the given event into the provided [Entity].

     * If [from] references another object as [main], this method is called for an exception (not a main event).

     * So you can use (note the referential equality operator):

     * ```
     * val buildsMainEvent = from === main
     * ```
     *
     * Note: The result of the mapping is used to either create or update the event row in the content provider.
     * For updates, explicit `null` values are required for fields that should be `null` (otherwise the value
     * wouldn't be updated to `null` in case of an event update). Sub-rows of the [Entity] will always be created
     * anew, so there's no need to use `null` values in sub-rows.
     *
     * @param from  event to map
     * @param main  main event
     * @param to    destination object where built values are stored (set `null` values, see note)
