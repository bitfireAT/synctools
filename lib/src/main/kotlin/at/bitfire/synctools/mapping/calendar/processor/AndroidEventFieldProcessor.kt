     * Takes specific data from an event (= event row plus data rows, taken from the content provider)

     * If [from] references the same object as [main], this method is called for a main event (not an exception).
     * If [from] references another object as [main], this method is called for an exception (not a main event).

     * ```
     * val isMainEvent = from === main  // or
     * val isException = from !== main

     * In a later step of refactoring, it should map to [net.fortuna.ical4j.model.component.VEvent].
